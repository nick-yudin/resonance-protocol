# Level 0: The Resonance Manifesto
**Status:** Final

## The Clock is the Enemy

For seventy years, computing has marched to the beat of a drum: the system clock. Every cycle, every millisecond, billions of transistors wake up, check for work, and go back to sleep.

In the era of centralized servers, this was acceptable.
In the era of Edge AI, it is suicide.

We are building a world of trillions of sensors. If they all "check in" every second, the noise will drown out the signal, and the energy cost will burn the planet.

**We propose a different axiom.**

## The Core Axiom

> **Intelligence is triggered by meaning, not by time.**

A camera staring at an empty wall should not process 30 frames per second. It should process **zero**. Ideally, it should consume near-zero watts. It should exist in a state of dormant potential.

It wakes only when **meaning** changes.

## The Principles of Resonance

### 1. Silence is the Default State
A perfectly functioning Resonance node is silent. It does not send "I'm alive" heartbeats. It does not stream empty logs. It speaks only when it has something semantic to say.

### 2. Meaning, Not Data
We do not transmit raw pixels, audio samples, or JSON strings. We transmit **Semantic Deltas**.
We calculate the vector difference between "The world now" and "The world a moment ago". If the difference is zero, no event exists.

### 3. Local Cognitive Autonomy
There is no cloud brain. The node decides what is meaningful *locally*. If the internet vanishes, the node continues to think, filter, and react.

### 4. Trust is Provenance
In a silent mesh, you cannot trust the channel; you must trust the message. Every semantic event carries the cryptographic signature of the hardware that sensed it.

## The Goal

We are building the **Quiet Mesh**.
A network that rests in silence and explodes into activity only when reality shifts.
This is not just an optimization. It is the only way to scale intelligence to the planetary level.

*The clock stops. The resonance begins.*
