1. HDC's structural composition enables perfect generalization
   to unseen combinations - critical for semantic event encoding.

2. No training required for HDC - just store vectors.
   Perfect for edge devices with limited compute.

3. As complexity grows, HDC maintains accuracy while
   transformers degrade - validates the rAI approach.

4. New concepts can be added to HDC without retraining -
   essential for adaptive distributed AI.
