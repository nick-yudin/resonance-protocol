# SEP Roadmap

**Mission:** Build meaning-triggered distributed AI through systematic experimentation.

**Philosophy:** The road will be made by walking.

---

## Completed Phases

### Phase 0: Protocol Foundation ✅
- Level 0 Manifesto (Philosophy)
- Level 1 Specification (Technical Standard)
- Reference implementation (Python)
- Website seprotocol.ai

### Phase 1: Core Experiments ✅
- M2.5: Data Efficiency
- M2.6: Compositional Generalization (100% accuracy)
- M3: Distributed Intelligence (32× compression, 93% cross-arch transfer)

### Phase 2: Semantic Transfer (M4 Series) ✅
- **M4c: Cross-Lingual Transfer** — 91.3% across 10 languages
- **M4d: Semantic Compositionality** — 110% retention (ternary improves!)
- **M4e: HDC vs Knowledge Distillation** — 98.4% competitive
- **Paper:** "...Until We Found Meaning" (draft complete)

**Key validation:** HDC captures universal meaning that transcends languages and survives extreme compression.

## Current Phase

### Phase 3: Hardware Proof of Concept (Q1-Q2 2026)

**Goal:** Demonstrate SEP on physical edge devices.

#### Hardware Stack

**Main Node:**
- **Jetson Orin Nano 8GB** — main node, GPU inference
- **Raspberry Pi 5 8GB × 2** — edge nodes

**Sensors:**
- USB webcam + microphone — sensors
- Ethernet mesh network

#### Experiments

- [ ] Distributed inference across Jetson + Pi mesh
- [ ] Semantic event communication (ternary vectors over network)
- [ ] Power consumption measurements
- [ ] "Silence vs Noise" split-screen demo
- [ ] Multi-teacher learning on physical nodes

#### Success Criteria

- Working 3-node mesh
- Measurable bandwidth reduction vs raw data
- Measurable power savings
- Video documentation

**Target completion:** Q2 2026

---

## Future Phases

### Phase 4: Multi-Teacher Mesh Learning (2026)

**Teaser result:** In simulation, student learning from 2 specialized teachers:
- Matches both teachers (96-99% accuracy)
- Teacher improves by learning back from student (+1%)

**Goal:** Nodes in mesh specialize and teach each other.

**Experiments:**
- Distributed curriculum learning
- Knowledge exchange patterns
- Emergent specialization

---

### Phase 5: Neuromorphic Hardware (2027+)

**Vision:**
- Memristor-based in-memory computing
- True ternary hardware (not emulated)
- Microjoule inference
- Event-driven sensors (DVS cameras, silicon cochlea)

**Dependencies:**
- Hardware availability
- Partnerships with chip manufacturers
- Research collaborations

**Possible platforms:**
- Intel Loihi
- BrainChip Akida
- Custom FPGA prototype

---

## Long-Term Vision

Distributed AI network where:
- Millions of edge devices contribute to collective intelligence
- No single point of control or failure
- Meaning is the unit of computation
- Training cost drops from $100M to $1M through distributed approach

**Philosophy:** AI should be like air — ubiquitous, invisible, and free.

## What This Is Not

**Not:** A startup pitch with hockey-stick growth charts
**Not:** A promise to replace NVIDIA by 2027
**Not:** A roadmap written by consultants

**Is:** A technical demonstration that alternatives are possible
**Is:** An invitation for collaborators who see the same problems
**Is:** A starting point, not a finish line

---

## On Team & Funding

**Current approach:** Self-funded experimental validation.

**After hardware PoC:** Present to:
- Decentralization advocates (technical web3 community)
- Privacy organizations (Signal, Tor ecosystem)
- AI sovereignty researchers (non-US academic labs)
- Neuromorphic computing community

**Team philosophy:** Inventor's project seeking collaborators, not CEO seeking employees.

---

## Standing on Shoulders

This work synthesizes decades of prior research:

- **Ternary computing:** Setun (1958, USSR)
- **Memristors:** Leon Chua (1971), HP Labs (2008)
- **HDC:** Pete Kanerva (2009)
- **Neuromorphic:** Carver Mead (1990), Intel Loihi (2017)
- **BitNet:** Microsoft Research (2024)
- **DVS cameras:** Delbruck et al. (2010)

None of these ideas are new. The synthesis is.

---

## Final Note

This roadmap will evolve. The goal isn't to predict the future — it's to build enough of it that the path forward becomes obvious.

**Status:** Semantic transfer validated through M4 series. Hardware validation phase next.

*"Attention was all we needed. Until we found meaning."*
